"Fortunately for those who pay their court through such foibles, a fond mother, though, in pursuit of praise for her children, the most rapacious of human beings, is likewise the most credulous; her demands are exorbitant; but she will swallow any thing...",,"Sense and Sensibility","Jane Austen",1811
"As it was impossible however now to prevent their coming, Lady Middleton resigned herself to the idea of it, with all the philosophy of a well bred woman, contenting herself with merely giving her husband a gentle reprimand on the subject five or six times every day.","Lady Middleton","Sense and Sensibility","Jane Austen",1811

"Nothing gave any symptom of that indigence [...] – no poverty of any kind, except of conversation, appeared – but there, the deficiency was considerable.",,"Sense and Sensibility","Jane Austen",1811

"I suppose you know, ma'am, that Mr. Ferrars is married.","Mr. Ferrars","Sense and Sensibility","Jane Austen",1811
"[...] an earnest, an unceasing attention to self-interest, however its progress may be apparently obstructed, will do in securing every advantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than that of time and conscience.",,"Sense and Sensibility","Jane Austen",1811
"A few years before, Anne Elliot had been a very pretty girl, but her bloom had vanished early; and as even in its height, her father had found little to admire in her, (so totally different were her delicate features and mild dark eyes from his own), there could be nothing in them, now that she was faded and thin, to excite his esteem.","Narrator","Persuasion","Jane Austen","1818"
"Vanity was the beginning and the end of Sir Walter Elliot's character; vanity of person and of situation. He had been remarkably handsome in his youth; and, at fifty-four, was still a very fine man. Few women could think more of their personal appearance than he did, nor could the valet of any new made lord be more delighted with the place he held in society. He considered the blessing of beauty as inferior only to the blessing of a baronetcy; and the Sir Walter Elliot, who united these gifts, was the constant object of his warmest respect and devotion.","Narrator","Persuasion","Jane Austen","1818"
"Elizabeth had succeeded at sixteen to all that was possible of her mother's rights and consequence; and being very handsome, and very like himself, her influence had always been great, and they had gone on together most happily. His other two children were of very inferior value. Mary had acquired a little artificial importance by becoming Mrs Charles Musgrove; but Anne, with an elegance of mind and sweetness of character, which must have placed her high with any people of real understanding, was nobody with either father or sister; her word had no weight, her convenience was always to give way — she was only Anne.","Narrator","Persuasion","Jane Austen","1818"
"How quick come the reasons for approving what we like!","Narrator","Persuasion","Jane Austen","1818"
"The navy, I think, who have done so much for us, have at least an equal claim with any other set of men, for all the comforts and all the privileges which any home can give. Sailors work hard enough for their comforts, we must all allow.","Anne Elliot","Persuasion","Jane Austen","1818"
"The profession has its utility, but I should be sorry to see any friend of mine belonging to it.","Sir Walter Elliot","Persuasion","Jane Austen","1818"
"Yes; it is in two points offensive to me; I have two strong grounds of objection to it. First, as a means of bringing persons of obscure birth into undue distinction, and raising men to honours which their fathers and grandfathers never dreamt of; and secondly, as it cuts up a man's youth and vigour most horribly; a sailor grows old sooner than any other man. I have observed it all my life. A man is in greater danger in the navy of being insulted by the rise of one whose father his father might have disdained to speak to, and of becoming prematurely an object of disgust himself, than in any other line.","Sir Walter Elliot","Persuasion","Jane Austen","1818"
"She had been forced into prudence in her youth, she learned romance as she grew older: the natural sequence of an unnatural beginning.","Narrator","Persuasion","Jane Austen","1818"
"He gave her a momentary glance, a glance of brightness, which seemed to say, 'That man is struck with you, and even I, at this moment, see something like Anne Elliot again.'","Narrator","Persuasion","Jane Austen","1818"
"My sore throats, you know, are always worse than anybody's.","Narrator","Persuasion","Jane Austen","1818"
"Anne hoped she had outlived the age of blushing; but the age of emotion she certainly had not.","Narrator","Persuasion","Jane Austen","1818"
"He had, in fact, though now his sisters were doing all they could for him, by calling him 'poor Richard,' been nothing better than a thick-headed, unfeeling, unprofitable Dick Musgrove, who had never done anything to entitle him to more than the abbreviation of his name, living or dead.","Narrator","Persuasion","Jane Austen","1818"
"Now they were as strangers; nay, worse than strangers, for they could never become acquainted.","Narrator","Persuasion","Jane Austen","1818"
"His cold politeness, his ceremonious grace, were worse than anything.","Narrator","Persuasion","Jane Austen","1818"
"I hate to hear you talking so like a fine gentleman, and as if women were all fine ladies, instead of rational creatures. We none of us expect to be in smooth water all our days.","Narrator","Persuasion","Jane Austen","1818"
"He could not forgive her, but he could not be unfeeling. Though condemning her for the past, and considering it with high and unjust resentment, though perfectly careless of her, and though becoming attached to another, still he could not see her suffer, without the desire of giving her relief. It was a remainder of former sentiment; it was an impulse of pure, though unacknowledged friendship; it was a proof of his own warm and amiable heart, which she could not contemplate without emotions so compounded of pleasure and pain, that she knew not which prevailed.","Narrator","Persuasion","Jane Austen","1818"
"Upon Lady Russell's appearance soon afterwards, the whole party was collected, and all that remained was to marshal themselves, and proceed into the Concert Room; and be of all the consequence in their power, draw as many eyes, excite as many whispers, and disturb as many people as they could.","Narrator","Persuasion","Jane Austen","1818"
"She thought it was the misfortune of poetry to be seldom safely enjoyed by those who enjoyed it completely; and that the strong feelings which alone could estimate it truly were the very feelings which ought to taste it but sparingly.","Narrator","Persuasion","Jane Austen","1818"
"It was evident that the gentleman, (completely a gentleman in manner) admired her exceedingly. Captain Wentworth looked round at her instantly in a way which shewed his noticing of it. He gave her a momentary glance, a glance of brightness, which seemed to say, 'That man is struck with you, and even I, at this moment, see something like Anne Elliot again.'","Narrator","Persuasion","Jane Austen","1818"
"One man's ways may be as good as another's, but we all like our own best.","Narrator","Persuasion","Jane Austen","1818"
"She left it to himself to recollect, that Mrs. Smith was not the only widow in Bath between thirty and forty, with little to live on, and no surname of dignity.","Narrator","Persuasion","Jane Austen","1818"
"Upon Lady Russell's appearance soon afterwards, the whole party was collected, and all that remained was to marshal themselves, and proceed into the Concert Room; and be of all the consequence in their power, draw as many eyes, excite as many whispers, and disturb as many people as they could.","Narrator","Persuasion","Jane Austen","1818"
"A man does not recover from such a devotion of the heart to such a woman! He ought not; he does not.","Narrator","Persuasion","Jane Austen","1818"
"She had spoken it; but she trembled when it was done, conscious that her words were listened to, and daring not even to try to observe their effect.","Narrator","Persuasion","Jane Austen","1818"
"All the privilege I claim for my own sex (it is not a very enviable one: you need not covet it), is that of loving longest, when existence or when hope is gone!","Anne Elliot","Persuasion","Jane Austen","1818"
"Dare not say that a man forgets sooner than woman, that his love has an earlier death. I have loved none but you. Unjust I may have been, weak and resentful I have been, but never inconstant. You pierce my soul. I am half agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever. I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it, eight and a half years ago. Dare not say that a man forgets sooner than woman, that his love has an earlier death. I have loved none but you. Unjust I may have been, weak and resentful I have been, but never inconstant.","Anne Elliot","Persuasion","Jane Austen","1818"
"If I was wrong in yielding to persuasion once, remember that it was to persuasion exerted on the side of safety, not of risk. When I yielded, I thought it was to duty; but no duty could be called in aid here. In marrying a man indifferent to me, all risk would have been incurred, and all duty violated.","Captain Wentworth","Persuasion","Jane Austen","1818"
"Anne was tenderness itself, and she had the full worth of it in Captain Wentworth's affection. His profession was all that could ever make her friends wish that tenderness less, the dread of a future war all that could dim her sunshine. She gloried in being a sailor's wife, but she must pay the tax of quick alarm for belonging to that profession which is, if possible, more distinguished in its domestic virtues than in its national importance.","Narrator","Persuasion","Jane Austen","1818"
"There is nothing I would not do for those who are really my friends. I have no notion of loving people by halves; it is not my nature.","Isabella Thorpe","Northanger Abbey","Jane Austen",1817
"The person, be it gentleman or lady, who has not pleasure in a good novel, must be intolerably stupid.","Mr. Tilney","Northanger Abbey","Jane Austen",1817

"Better be without sense, than misapply it as you do.","Mr. Knightley","Emma","Jane Austen","1816"

"Business, you know, may bring money, but friendship hardly ever does.","Mr. John Knightley","Emma","Jane Austen","1816"
"A man would always wish to give a woman a better home than the one he takes her from; and he who can do it, where there is no doubt of her regard, must, I think, be the happiest of mortals.","Mr. Knightley","Emma","Jane Austen","1816"
"It is very difficult for the prosperous to be humble.","Frank Churchill","Emma","Jane Austen","1816"
"Depend upon it, you see but half. You see the evil, but you do not see the consolation. There will be little rubs and disappointments everywhere, and we are all apt to expect too much; but then, if one scheme of happiness fails, human nature turns to another; if the first calculation is wrong, we make a second better: we find comfort somewhere—and those evil-minded observers, dearest Mary, who make much of a little, are more taken in and deceived than the parties themselves.",,"Mansfield Park","Jane Austen","1814"
"Everybody likes to go their own way—to choose their own time and manner of devotion.",,"Mansfield Park","Jane Austen","1814"
"I cannot think well of a man who sports with any woman's feelings; and there may often be a great deal more suffered than a stander-by can judge of.",,"Mansfield Park","Jane Austen","1814"
""I pay very little regard, to what any young person says on the subject of marriage. If they profess a disinclination for it, I only set it down that they have not yet seen the right person."","Mrs. Grant","Mansfield Park","Jane Austen","1814"
"How wonderful, how very wonderful the operations of time, and the changes of the human mind!",,"Mansfield Park","Jane Austen","1814"
"If any one faculty of our nature may be called more wonderful than the rest, I do think it is memory. There seems something more speakingly incomprehensible in the powers, the failures, the inequalities of memory, than in any other of our intelligences. The memory is sometimes so retentive, so serviceable, so obedient; at others, so bewildered and so weak; and at others again, so tyrannic, so beyond control! We are, to be sure, a miracle every way; but our powers of recollecting and of forgetting do seem peculiarly past finding out.",,"Mansfield Park","Jane Austen","1814"
"Oh! do not attack me with your watch. A watch is always too fast or too slow. I cannot be dictated to by a watch.",,"Mansfield Park","Jane Austen","1814"
"One cannot fix one's eyes on the commonest natural production without finding food for a rambling fancy.",,"Mansfield Park","Jane Austen","1814"
"Selfishness must always be forgiven, you know, because there is no hope of a cure.",,"Mansfield Park","Jane Austen","1814"
"We have all a better guide in ourselves, if we would attend to it, than any other person can be.",,"Mansfield Park","Jane Austen","1814"
"Vanity and pride are different things, though the words are often used synonymously. A person may be proud without being vain. Pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves, vanity to what we would have others think of us.","Mary","Pride and Prejudice","Jane Austen",1813
"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.","Narrator","Pride and Prejudice","Jane Austen",1813
"Mr. Bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts, sarcastic, humour, reserve, and caprice, that the experience of three-and-twenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character.","Narrator","Pride and Prejudice","Jane Austen",1813
"What say you, Mary? for you are a young lady of deep reflection, I know, and read great books and make extracts.","Mrs. Bennet","Pride and Prejudice","Jane Austen",1813
"Nothing could be more delightful! To be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love; and very lively hopes of Mr. Bingley's heart were entertained.","Narrator","Pride and Prejudice","Jane Austen",1813
"She is tolerable; but not handsome enough to tempt me; I am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men.","Mr. Darcy","Pride and Prejudice","Jane Austen",1813
"I could easily forgive his pride, if he had not mortified mine.","Elizabeth Bennet","Pride and Prejudice","Jane Austen",1813
"But I can assure you that Lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy; for he is a most disagreeable, horrid man.","Mrs. Bennet","Pride and Prejudice","Jane Austen",1813

"Mr. Darcy, you see, is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I have surprised you.","Mr. Bingley","Pride and Prejudice","Jane Austen",1813
"We must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured.","Elizabeth Bennet","Pride and Prejudice","Jane Austen",1813

"Mr. Darcy is the man! Now, Lizzy, I think I have surprised you.","Mr. Bingley","Pride and Prejudice","Jane Austen",1813
"I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose. A fool takes in all the lumber of every sort that he comes across, so that the knowledge which might be useful to him gets crowded out, or at best is jumbled up with a lot of other things, so that he has a difficulty in laying his hands upon it. Now the skillful workman is very careful indeed as to what he takes into his brain-attic. He will have nothing but the tools which may help him in doing his work, but of these he has a large assortment, and all in the most perfect order. It is a mistake to think that this little room has elastic walls and can distend to any extent. Depend upon it, there comes a time when for any addition of knowledge, you forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the useful ones.",Sherlock Holmes,The Sign of the Four,Arthur Conan Doyle,1890
"Before turning to those moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest difficulties, let the inquirer begin by mastering more elementary problems.",Sherlock Holmes,The Sign of the Four,Arthur Conan Doyle,1890

"It is a capital mistake to theorize before you have all the evidence. It biases the judgment.",Sherlock Holmes,A Study in Scarlet,Arthur Conan Doyle,1887
"One's ideas must be as broad as Nature if they are to interpret Nature.",Sherlock Holmes,The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,Arthur Conan Doyle,1892
"When a fact appears to be opposed to a long train of deductions, it invariably proves to be capable of bearing some other interpretation.",Sherlock Holmes,The Sign of the Four,Arthur Conan Doyle,1890
"Life is infinitely stranger than anything which the mind of man could invent. We would not dare to conceive the things which are really mere commonplaces of existence. If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep in at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most outre results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable.",Sherlock Holmes,The Sign of the Four,Arthur Conan Doyle,1890
"Never trust to general impressions, my boy, but concentrate yourself upon details.",Sherlock Holmes,The Sign of the Four,Arthur Conan Doyle,1890
